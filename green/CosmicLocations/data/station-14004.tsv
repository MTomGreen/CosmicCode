# This data contains the following columns:
#
# date:                time of event [GPS calendar date]
# time:                time of event [GPS time of day]
# timestamp:           time of event [UNIX timestamp]
# nanoseconds:         time of event [number of nanoseconds after timestamp]
# pulseheights (4x):   maximum signal pulseheight [ADC]
# integral (4x):       integral of the signal [ADC.ns]
# number_of_mips (4x): estimate for the number of particles in the detector
# arrival_times (4x):  relative time of arrival of the first particle in the detector [ns]
# trigger_time:        relative time of the trigger timestamp [ns]
# zenith:              reconstructed shower axis zenith angle [deg]
# azimuth:             reconstructed shower axis azimuth angle [deg]
#
# Values of -1 for detectors 3 and 4 indicate that the station only has
# two detectors.  Values of -999 indicate a problem in the analysis of
# that particular event.  This may be the result from noise in the
# signal or not enough data for reconstruction.
